# Serverless TODO

To implement this project you need to implement a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. Search for all the `TODO:` comments in the code to find the placeholders that you need to implement.

# Functionality of the application

This appliation will allow to create/remove/update/get TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created. 

# Functions to be implemented

To implement this project you need to implement the following functions and configure them in the `serverless.yml` file:

* `Auth` - this function should implement a custom authorizer for API Gateway that should be added to all other functions.
* `GetTodos` - should return all TODOs for a current user. 
* `CreateTodo` - should create a new TODO for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `CreateTodoRequest.ts` file
* `UpdateTodo` - should update a TODO item created by a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `UpdateTodoRequest.ts` file
* `DeleteTodo` - should delete a TODO item created by a current user. Expects an id of a TODO item to remove.
* `GenerateUploadUrl` - returns a presigned url that can be used to upload an attachment file for a TODO item. 

All functions are already connected to appriate events from API gateway

An id of a user can be extracted from a JWT token passed by a client

You also need to add any necessary resources to the `resources` section of the `serverless.yml` file such as DynamoDB table and and S3 bucket.

# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.

To use it please edit the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder:

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```

# Best practices

To complete this exercise please follow the best practices from the 6th lesson of this course.

# Suggestions

To store TODO items you might want to use a DynamoDB table with local secondary index(es). A create a local secondary index you need to a create a DynamoDB resource like this:

```yml

TodosTable:
  Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
  Properties:
    AttributeDefinitions:
      - AttributeName: partitionKey
        AttributeType: S
      - AttributeName: sortKey
        AttributeType: S
      - AttributeName: indexKey
        AttributeType: S
    KeySchema:
      - AttributeName: partitionKey
        KeyType: HASH
      - AttributeName: sortKey
        KeyType: RANGE
    BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
    TableName: ${self:provider.environment.TODOS_TABLE}
    LocalSecondaryIndexes:
      - IndexName: ${self:provider.environment.INDEX_NAME}
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: partitionKey
            KeyType: HASH
          - AttributeName: indexKey
            KeyType: RANGE
        Projection:
          ProjectionType: ALL # What attributes will be copied to an index

```

To query an index you need to use the `query()` method like:

```ts
await this.dynamoDBClient
  .query({
    TableName: 'table-name',
    IndexName: 'index-name',
    KeyConditionExpression: 'paritionKey = :paritionKey',
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
      ':paritionKey': partitionKeyValue
    }
  })
  .promise()
```

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project. To import this collection do the following.

Click on the import button:

Click on the "Choose Files":

![Alt text](images/import-collection-2.png?raw=true "Image 2")


Select a file to import:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-3.png?raw=true "Image 3")


Right click on the imported collection to set variables for the collection:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-4.png?raw=true "Image 4")

Provide variables for the collection (similarly to how this was done in the course):

![Alt text](images/import-collection-5.png?raw=true "Image 5")
